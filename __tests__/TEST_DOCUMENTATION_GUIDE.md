# Test Documentation Guide

This guide establishes standards for documenting test files in the doc-to-md project. Following these guidelines ensures tests are auditable without requiring in-depth code reading.

## Documentation Structure

Each test file should include a documentation header with the following sections:

### 1. Test Suite Title and Separator
```typescript
/**
 * Test Suite: [filename].test.ts
 * ==============================
 */
```

### 2. Purpose
A concise description of what the test suite validates and its importance.
```typescript
/**
 * Purpose:
 * This test suite validates [component/functionality] which is responsible for
 * [description of responsibility].
 */
```

### 3. Key Components Tested
A bullet list of the main components, functions, or behaviors tested.
```typescript
/**
 * Key Components Tested:
 * - ComponentA initialization and configuration
 * - Function behavior under various conditions
 * - Error handling and edge cases
 */
```

### 4. Test Groups
A numbered list of the logical test groups within the suite.
```typescript
/**
 * Test Groups:
 * 1. Group name - Brief description of what this group tests
 * 2. Another group - What these tests validate
 */
```

### 5. Environment Setup (if applicable)
Description of how the test environment is configured.
```typescript
/**
 * Environment Setup:
 * - Dependencies are mocked in specific ways
 * - Test data is created with certain characteristics
 */
```

## Example

```typescript
/**
 * Test Suite: translateFiles.test.ts
 * ==================================
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * This test suite validates the file translation functionality, including
 * language detection, file handling, and translation processes.
 * 
 * Key Components Tested:
 * - translateFiles function
 * - MistralService integration
 * - TokenCountService integration
 * - File system operations
 * 
 * Test Groups:
 * 1. Input validation - Tests for various input parameters and their validation
 * 2. File handling - Tests for file existence, reading, and writing operations
 * 3. Translation process - Tests for the core translation functionality
 * 4. Error handling - Tests for various error scenarios
 * 
 * Environment Setup:
 * - All external dependencies are mocked
 * - Test data is created in-memory to simulate file operations
 */
```

## Documentation for Different Test Types

### Unit Tests
Focus on the specific function/component being tested and its behavior under different conditions.

### Integration Tests
Emphasize the interaction between components and the flow of data between them.

### Setup Files
Clearly document the global configuration and its impact on the test environment.

## Maintaining Documentation

- Update documentation when test functionality changes
- Ensure consistency across all test files
- Regularly review documentation for accuracy

Following these guidelines will make it easier for team members to understand test coverage, identify gaps, and maintain the test suite effectively.
